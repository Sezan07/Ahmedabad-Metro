GMRC is working hard to meet expectations of passengers and is committed to providing a delightful experience. A mechanism has been developed to address passenger grievances, queries, suggestions, appreciation, and feedback through the Centralized Customer Care Centre. Passengers can contact via phone at +91-79-22960123, email at care@gujaratmetrorail.com, or by submitting a duly filled form in person at an operational station. Note: The centralized customer care handles only operational matters of Ahmedabad Metro. For other matters, please contact the registered office of Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) Limited using the details provided in the Contact Us section.

In case you hear or see something unusual, please inform Metro staff or security personnel inside trains or stations. Stand in queue while waiting for trains at the platform. Let passengers exit from the train before boarding. Never squat on the train floor. Limit your baggage to 25 kgs not exceeding 80 cm (Length) x 50 cm (Breadth) x 30 cm (Height) in size. Luggage exceeding such weight and/or dimensions is not allowed. Avoid reading newspapers or crossing legs in crowded trains as it leaves less space for fellow passengers. Abstain from drunken and unruly behaviour. Watch the gap between the train and platform edge. It is illegal to beg, solicit products, or conduct group activities in the train and at the station. Please report such activities to the station staff. Please be sure to take all your belongings with you when you get off the train. If you lose something within metro premises, contact the GMRC Lost & Found Cell.

Do not spit or throw garbage within Metro premises. Do not eat or drink inside trains and the paid area of stations. Do not bring pets inside Metro stations. Do not smoke inside Metro premises. Do not travel without valid token media. Do not jump over the ticket barrier. Do not share your ticket media with another person on the same journey. Do not step onto the Metro track, as the 3rd rail is charged with 750 V DC. Do not try to open the doors forcibly. Do not deface or put posters inside the Metro station or train.

The GMRC Smart Card (CSC) must be tapped at the Entry Fare Gate to enter the paid area and again at the Exit Fare Gate to leave it. Each entry must be followed by an exit while using the CSC; failing to do so results in an Entry-Exit Mismatch Error, for which the passenger should contact Customer Care at the station. A minimum stored value equivalent to the minimum fare of the system is required to enter. The fare is deducted at the Exit Fare Gate based on the journey; if the entry and exit are at the same station, the minimum fare is deducted. Passengers can check their stored value at Token Vending Machines (TVM), Recharge Card Machines (RCM), and ENQ Machines.

The GMRC Smart Card (CSC) offers several benefits. Passengers using the CSC receive a 10% discount upon completing their journey, helping them save money. It also saves time and provides convenience, as there is no need to stand in line to buy tokens, allowing passengers to board the train at the last moment. The smart card offers great flexibility and can be used by friends, family, or relatives (one person at a time). Additionally, it provides the freedom to extend or end a journey without prior planning, as the fare is calculated and deducted at the Exit Fare Gates.

The stored value amount on a GMRC Smart Card (CSC) is not refundable in cash. If a CSC becomes unreadable, the stored value will be transferred to a new CSC in accordance with GMRC's business rules. For readable CSCs, only the security deposit is refundable, after deducting administrative charges (₹20) and any negative balance, as per the business rules. The process for refunding the stored value from an unreadable CSC to a new CSC may take up to 7 days. Note: GMRC Ltd. is not liable for the loss of the Smart Card (CSC).

GMRC offers several fare products for travel within its network, including Single Journey Tickets, Return Journey Tickets, and Group Tickets for groups of more than nine passengers. Two children under three feet in height can travel free when accompanied by one adult. Tickets can be purchased from ticket windows at all operational stations using cash, UPI, or debit/credit cards. Additionally, QR-tickets can be bought online via the official GMRC mobile app using UPI or card payments. All tickets are valid only for the business day on which they are purchased, based on the operational timetable.

Ticket refunds are allowed only for unused QR-paper tickets or tokens, and must be claimed within 30 minutes of issue at the issuing station. The maximum permissible time for travel is 20 minutes if exiting the same station and 240 minutes if exiting from a different station. Passengers are allowed to carry luggage up to 25 kg with dimensions not exceeding 80 cm × 50 cm × 30 cm; items exceeding this limit are not permitted. Penalties apply for various violations: ₹200 for attempting to carry tokens outside GMRC premises, ₹50 plus maximum fare for being in the paid area without a valid ticket, ₹50 plus the fare difference for fare evasion (e.g., tailgating or gate-jumping), and ₹10 per hour per person for overstaying beyond the permitted time, up to ₹50 per person.
